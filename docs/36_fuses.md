# Fuses

## 1. Definition
### 1.1 Fuse

A fuse is a protective component designed to **disconnect a circuit** when the electrical current exceeds a safe limit.  
It contains a thin conductor that melts when overheated, stopping the flow of electricity and protecting components from damage.

### 1.2 Types of Fuses

- **Glass Cartridge Fuse** : transparent tube, common in electronics.
- **Blade Fuse (Automotive)** : plastic body with metal blades, used in vehicles.
- **Resettable Polyfuse (PTC)** : automatically recovers after the fault is removed.



## 2. Features

* **Current rating** : maximum current before fuse blows (e.g., 1A, 10A).
* **Voltage rating** : maximum circuit voltage it can safely interrupt.
* **Blow characteristics** : 
  - *Fast-blow*: trips quickly for sensitive electronics.
  - *Slow-blow*: tolerates short surges, used with motors or power supplies.
* **Reset type** : single-use (replaceable) or resettable.



## 4. How to Use
### Safety Note
Always replace a blown fuse with one that has the **same current and voltage rating**. Using a higher-rated fuse can cause overheating and fire hazards.



### 4.1 Identify Fuse Rating

* Ratings are usually printed on the fuse body or metal caps.
* Example: “250V 5A” means it will blow at currents above 5A at up to 250V.

### 4.2 Installing a Fuse

* Place **in series** with the circuit or device being protected.
* Ensure proper mechanical mounting (fuse holder or PCB mount).
* For automotive fuses, insert into the correct slot in the fuse box.



### 4.3 Applications

* Circuit protection in electronics.
* Automotive wiring systems.
* AC/DC power supplies.
* Industrial control systems.
