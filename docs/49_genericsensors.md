# Generic Sensors

## 1. Definition
### 1.1 Generic Sensor
A generic sensor is a device that detects or measures a physical property (such as temperature, light, pressure, or distance) and converts it into an electrical signal for processing or display.

**Key Function:** Detects various physical parameters and outputs signals that can be read by microcontrollers or other devices.


## 2. Types of Generic Sensors
- **Temperature Sensors** : e.g., LM35, DHT11, DS18B20  
- **Light Sensors** : e.g., LDR (Light Dependent Resistor), photodiodes  
- **Pressure Sensors** : e.g., BMP180, barometers  
- **Gas Sensors** : e.g., MQ series (MQ-2, MQ-135)  
- **Proximity Sensors** : e.g., capacitive, inductive sensors


## 3. Working Principle
A generic sensor works by:
1. **Sensing** a change in a physical parameter.  
2. **Converting** it into an electrical signal (analog or digital).  
3. **Sending** the signal to a microcontroller or processing unit for interpretation.


## 4. Applications
- Weather monitoring systems  
- Home automation  
- Industrial automation  
- Safety and security systems  
- Robotics and IoT projects



## 5. Advantages
- Wide variety of types for different measurements  
- Easy to interface with microcontrollers  
- Cost-effective for most applications  
- Compact and lightweight designs



## 6. Limitations
- Limited measurement range depending on type  
- Accuracy may vary with environmental conditions  
- Requires calibration for precise readings



## 7. Safety Notes
***Note:*** Handle sensors with care to avoid mechanical damage or electrical shock. Ensure proper wiring to prevent short circuits.
