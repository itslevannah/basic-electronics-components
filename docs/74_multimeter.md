# Multimeter

## 1. Definition
A **Multimeter** is an electronic measuring instrument that combines several measurement functions in one unit.  
It can measure **voltage, current, resistance, and continuity**. Advanced models also test **capacitance, frequency, and temperature**.

## 2. Types
- **Analog Multimeter:** Uses a moving needle on a scale.  
- **Digital Multimeter (DMM):** Displays measurements on an LCD, more accurate and widely used.

## 3. Applications
- Checking **battery voltage**.  
- Measuring **current flow in circuits**.  
- Testing **resistors and continuity**.  
- Diagnosing **circuit faults**.  

## 4. Notes
Always start on the highest range to avoid damaging the meter.  
Never measure resistance in a powered circuit.
