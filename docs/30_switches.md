# Switches

## 1. Definition
### 1.1 Switch

A switch is an electromechanical device used to open or close an electrical circuit, thereby controlling the flow of current.  
It can be **manually operated** (toggle, push-button) or **mechanically triggered** (limit switch).

### 1.2 Types of Switches

- **SPST:** Single Pole, Single Throw (simple on/off).
- **SPDT:** Single Pole, Double Throw.
- **DPST/DPDT:** Double Pole variations.
- **Momentary:** Normally open (NO) or normally closed (NC).

## 2. Features

* Simple operation.
* Mechanical lifespan (number of actuations).
* Contact rating (voltage & current).
* Mounting style (panel, PCB).

## 4. How to Use
### Safety Note
Always ensure the switch is rated for the circuit voltage and current.

### 4.1 Identify terminals

* **SPST:** Two terminals.  
* **SPDT:** Three terminals (common, NO, NC).
