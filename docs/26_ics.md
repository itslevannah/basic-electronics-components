# Integrated Circuits (ICs)

## 1. Definition
### 1.1 IC

An Integrated Circuit (IC) is a compact package containing multiple interconnected electronic components (transistors, resistors, capacitors) built on a semiconductor chip to perform a specific function.

### 1.2 Types of ICs

- **Analog ICs:** Amplifiers, regulators.
- **Digital ICs:** Logic gates, microcontrollers.
- **Mixed-signal ICs:** ADCs, DACs.

### 1.3 Common IC families
* **555 Timer** IC , for timing, oscillators, and pulse generation.

* Operational Amplifiers (**Op-Amps**) , e.g., LM358, LM741, used for signal amplification.

* **7400-series** Logic ICs , TTL logic gates, flip-flops, counters.

* **4000-series** Logic ICs , CMOS versions of logic gates, often lower power.

* Famous **Early Microprocessors** (historical interest) , Intel 4004, MOS 6502, Zilog Z80, Motorola 6800.

* **LM-series Analog** ICs , e.g., LM317 voltage regulator, LM386 audio amplifier.

## 2. Features

* **High Component Density**.
* **Small Size** and lightweight.
* **Low Power Consumption**.
* **Reliable** with long lifespan.

## 4. How to Use
### Safety Note
Always check IC datasheet for correct voltage and pin configuration.

### 4.1 Identify pins

* Pin 1 marked by dot or notch.
* Follow datasheet pinout.


### 4.2 Mounting

* **DIP ICs:** Insert into socket or breadboard.
* **SMD ICs:** Solder on PCB.

### 4.3 Power supply

* Apply correct Vcc/GND as per datasheet.

### 4.4 Install in circuit

* Use decoupling capacitors close to Vcc pin.
