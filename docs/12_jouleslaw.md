# Joule’s Law

## 1. Definition
Joule’s Law states that **the heat produced in a conductor due to an electric current is proportional to the square of the current, the resistance of the conductor, and the time for which the current flows**.

**Expirement**

An electric current passes through a heating coil immersed in water inside a calorimeter. The digital thermometer measures the rise in water temperature over time. By recording the current, resistance, and time, the experiment confirms that the heat generated matches Q=I2Rt, demonstrating Joule’s Law in action.

### 1.1. Formula
**Q = I² × R × t**
where:  
- **Q** = Heat energy produced (in joules)  
- **I** = Current (in amperes)  
- **R** = Resistance (in ohms)  
- **t** = Time (in seconds)  



## 2.1. Explanation
When an electric current flows through a conductor, the moving electrons collide with the atoms of the material.  
These collisions convert electrical energy into heat energy. Joule’s Law quantifies the relationship between current, resistance, and heat produced.



## 2. Usage
1. **Electric heating devices** (e.g., toasters, electric kettles, irons)
2. **Incandescent light bulbs**
3. **Fuses and circuit breakers** (heat causes them to operate)
- **Soldering irons**


## 4. Important Notes
- The heat generated increases **with the square of the current** ; doubling the current produces **four times the heat**.
- High resistance materials generate more heat for the same current.
- Excessive heat can damage components if not managed properly.

## 5. Limitations
1. Assumes **resistance is constant** (not true if temperature changes).
2. Applies mainly to **purely resistive conductors** (ohmic materials).
3. **Heat losses** to surroundings are ignored.
4. Valid for **steady DC currents** (AC requires RMS values).
