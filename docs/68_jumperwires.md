# Jumper Wires

## 1. Definition
**Jumper Wires** are small electrical wires with connector pins at the ends, used to make quick and easy connections between components, breadboards, and modules.  
They are essential for prototyping and experimenting with circuits without the need for soldering.

## 2. Types of Jumper Wires
- **Male-to-Male (M-M):** Used to connect two breadboard points.  
- **Male-to-Female (M-F):** Connects a breadboard to modules/sensors with female headers.  
- **Female-to-Female (F-F):** Connects modules together without a breadboard.  
- **Dupont Wires:** Standard jumper wires with plastic connectors, available in sets or ribbon cables.

## 3. Applications
- Connecting components on a breadboard.  
- Linking microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi) to sensors, displays, or modules.  
- Creating temporary circuits for testing and debugging.  
- Extending connections where direct pins cannot reach.

## 4. Precautions
- Ensure connections are firm to avoid loose circuits.  
- Do not bend the pins too much; they may break or lose contact.  
- Avoid mixing power (VCC) and ground (GND) accidentally, as this can short the circuit.  
- Use color-coded wires (e.g., red for power, black for ground) to stay organized.
