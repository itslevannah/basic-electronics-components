# Logic Analyzer

## 1. Definition
A **Logic Analyzer** is a tool that captures and displays multiple digital signals.  
It helps in analyzing **timing, logic states (HIGH/LOW), and communication protocols**.

## 2. Types
- **Standalone Logic Analyzer:** Dedicated device with many channels.  
- **PC-based Logic Analyzer:** USB dongles with software for visualization.  

## 3. Applications
- Debugging **digital communication (UART, SPI, IÂ²C, etc.)**.  
- Checking **timing relationships between signals**.  
- Analyzing **microcontroller outputs**.  
- Detecting **glitches or protocol errors**.  

## 4. Notes
Unlike an oscilloscope, it only detects logic levels (HIGH/LOW), not analog voltage levels.  
Ensure correct ground connection before capturing signals.
