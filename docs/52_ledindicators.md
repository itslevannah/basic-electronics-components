# LED Indicators

## 1. Definition
LED indicators are small light-emitting diodes used to provide visual feedback in electronic devices.  
They signal the status, activity, or mode of operation by emitting light of different colors.

## 2. Key Characteristics
- **Visual Feedback:** Indicates power status, errors, or operational states.
- **Color-Coded Signals:** Red, green, blue, and other colors to convey specific meanings.
- **Low Power Consumption:** Energy-efficient compared to traditional bulbs.
- **Long Lifespan:** Can last tens of thousands of hours.

## 3. Applications
- **Status Indicators:** Power on/off, battery charging, or error notifications.
- **Signal Indicators:** Data transfer activity or connectivity status.
- **User Interfaces:** Buttons, panels, or dashboards with embedded LEDs.
- **Safety Alerts:** Warning lights in machinery or control systems.

## 4. Usage Notes
- Always use a current-limiting resistor to protect the LED from damage.
- Observe polarity: LEDs have an anode (+) and cathode (âˆ’).
- Avoid looking directly at high-brightness LEDs to prevent eye strain.

**Note:** Handle LEDs carefully, as excessive heat or overvoltage can shorten their lifespan.
