# Coulomb’s Law

## 1. Definition
Coulomb’s Law states that **the electric force between two charged objects is directly proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.**

### 1.1. In Formula Form
F = k · (q₁ · q₂) / r²

Where:
- **F** : *Electric force* between the charges
- **k** : *Coulomb’s constant* (≈ 8.99 × 10⁹ N·m²/C²)
- **q₁**, **q₂** : *Magnitudes of the charges* (in Coulombs)
- **r** : *Distance between the charges* (in meters)

### 1.2. Other Variations
- Vector Form:
    F = k · (q₁ · q₂ / r²) · r̂
    where **r̂** is **the unit vector** pointing from one charge to the other.

- If the charges have the same sign → the force is repulsive.

- If the charges have opposite signs → the force is attractive.



### 1.3. Unit of Measurements

* Force (F): Newton (N)
* Charge (q): Coulomb (C)
* Distance (r): meter (m)
* Coulomb’s constant (k): N·m²/C²

### 1.4. Example
If q₁ = 2 C, q₂ = 3 C, and r = 2 m:
F = (8.99 × 10⁹) × (2 × 3) / (2²)
=> F = (8.99 × 10⁹ × 6) / 4
=> F = (53.94 × 10⁹) / 4
=> F = 13.485 × 10⁹ N

## 2. Usage
### 2.1. Calculations

Coulomb’s Law helps you calculate:
1. The magnitude of electric force between two charges
2. Whether the force is attractive or repulsive
3. The effect of changing distance or charge magnitude on the force

### 2. Applications
It is used in:

1. Analyzing electrostatic forces in physics problems
2. Designing capacitors and other charge-storage devices
3. Understanding molecular bonding and interactions in chemistry
4. Studying atomic structure and electron behavior

## 3. Limitations
It is important to note that Coulomb’s Law has the following limitations:
- It applies only to point charges or spherical charge distributions.
- It assumes the charges are stationary (not moving).
- It is accurate only when the medium is uniform (like a vacuum or air, unless adjusted for permittivity).
- It ignores quantum effects at very small scales.
