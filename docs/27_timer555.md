# 555 Timer IC

## 1. Definition
### 1.1 What is the 555 Timer?

The **555 Timer** is one of the most popular integrated circuits ever made.  
It can create **timing** and **pulses** in electronic circuits, like a stopwatch inside a chip.  

It’s famous because it’s:
- Easy to use.
- Cheap.
- Works with just a few extra parts (resistors and capacitors).

It can work in three basic modes:
- **Monostable** : one pulse when triggered (like a camera shutter).  
- **Astable** : keeps pulsing on and off (like a blinking LED).  
- **Bistable** : stays on or off until told to change (like a light switch).

## 2. Features

* Works with supply voltages from **4.5V to 15V**.
* Can drive LEDs, speakers, or small motors directly (up to 200 mA).
* Adjustable timing with resistors and capacitors.
* Simple and cheap , great for learning electronics.


## 4. How to Use
### Safety Note
If wired incorrectly, the IC can overheat or stop working. Always double-check your pin connections.


### 4.1 Pin functions

1. **GND** : Ground (negative side of the power supply).  
2. **TRIG** : Starts the timing cycle when voltage drops below 1/3 of supply.  
3. **OUT** : Output pin (goes HIGH or LOW depending on timing).  
4. **RESET** : Resets the timer when pulled LOW (connect to VCC if not used).  
5. **CTRL** : Changes the internal voltage threshold (usually left unconnected).  
6. **THR** : Ends the timing cycle when voltage rises above 2/3 of supply.  
7. **DISCH** : Discharges the timing capacitor.  
8. **VCC** : Positive supply voltage.


### 4.2 Example: Blinking LED (Astable mode)

In **astable mode**, the 555 outputs a repeating ON-OFF signal.

**Frequency formula:**

 **f = 1.44 / (R1+2r2).C**

**Example:**  
- R1 = 1 kΩ, R2 = 4.7 kΩ, C = 100 µF  
- Produces about 1 blink per second.


### 4.3 Example applications

* LED blinkers and flashers.  
* Tone generators for buzzers.  
* Delay circuits (e.g., light turns off after a few seconds).  
* Simple PWM motor speed control.
