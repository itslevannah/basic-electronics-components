# Schematic vs Circuit

## 1. Definition
When working with electronics, you will often see two different ways of showing a project: **Schematics** and **Circuits**.  
They are closely related but serve different purposes.

- A **Schematic** is a drawing that shows the **symbols** of components and how they are connected.  
- A **Circuit** is the **real-life physical connection** of those components on a breadboard, PCB, or wires.


## 2. Schematic Diagram
- Uses **standard symbols** for resistors, capacitors, LEDs, ICs, etc.  
- Shows the **logic and electrical connections** between components.  
- Helps in planning, troubleshooting, and documenting projects.  

 *Think of it like a **map** of your circuit.*

Example (schematic of LED + resistor):

## 3. Circuit (Physical Build)
- The actual **hardware setup** made with breadboards, jumper wires, or PCBs.  
- Components are placed physically and wired together.  
- May look messy, but it works exactly as the schematic describes.  

ðŸ“Œ *Think of it like the **real city** that the map (schematic) represents.*

Example:  
- Breadboard with a resistor connected to an LED and powered by a 5V supply.

## 4. Key Differences

| Feature           | Schematic                   | Circuit (Physical)           |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Looks like**    | A symbolic drawing          | Real components & wires      |
| **Purpose**       | Understanding & planning    | Building & testing           |
| **Clarity**       | Very clear and simplified   | Can get messy with wires     |
| **Where used**    | Documentation, design       | Prototypes, final hardware   |



## 5. Beginner Tips
- **Always start with a schematic** before building the circuit.  
- If something doesnâ€™t work, check your build against the schematic.  
- Schematics make it easier to share projects with others.

 **In short:** *A schematic is the "blueprint," and the circuit is the "house" you build from it.*
