# Lenz’s Law
## 1. Definition
Lenz's Law states that **the direction of the induced current in a conductor is such that it opposes the change in magnetic flux that caused it.**

### 1.1 Formula
**E = -N × (ΔΦ / Δt)**
where:
- **E** = induced electromotive force (EMF) in volts  
- **N** = number of turns in the coil  
- **ΔΦ** = change in magnetic flux (in Weber)  
- **Δt** = change in time (in seconds)  
- The **negative sign** represents the opposition (as per Lenz's Law).

### 1.2 Explanation
When the magnetic environment of a coil changes (e.g., moving a magnet toward or away), an EMF is induced.  
The resulting current generates its own magnetic field that **opposes the original change**.


### 1.3 Example
- **Magnet toward coil** → Coil current produces a repelling magnetic field.  
- **Magnet away from coil** → Coil current produces an attracting magnetic field

**Explanation of the experiment:**  
Two aluminum rings are mounted on a pivot:  
- **Closed ring:** Moves away when a magnet approaches, and toward it when the magnet is removed.  
- **Open ring:** Shows little to no movement because current cannot circulate.

## 2. Usage
Lenz’s Law helps determine **the direction of induced currents** when a conductor is exposed to a changing magnetic field.  
Applications:
- **Electric Generators** : Predict induced voltage polarity.  
- **Transformers** : Understand opposing currents affecting energy transfer.  
- **Electromagnetic Braking** : Calculate braking force via eddy currents.  
- **Induction Heating** : Design metal heating systems.  
- **Magnetic Levitation** : Control repulsive forces for suspension.

## 3. Limitations
- **No magnitude prediction** : Only gives direction (magnitude requires Faraday’s Law).  
- **Ideal assumptions** : Assumes perfect conductors and no energy loss.  
- **Needs changing magnetic flux** : Constant fields induce no current.  
- **Material dependent** : Efficiency varies with conductor properties.  
- **Ignores relativistic effects** : At extreme speeds or strong fields, more advanced theory is needed.
