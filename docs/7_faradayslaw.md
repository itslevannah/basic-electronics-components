# Faraday’s Law of Electromagnetic Induction

## 1. What is Induction?

Electromagnetic induction is the process of **generating an electric current in a conductor by changing the magnetic field around it.**

It happens in two main ways:
1. **Moving the conductor** through a magnetic field (like in a generator).
2. **Changing the strength or direction of the magnetic field** around a stationary conductor (like in a transformer).

*What is a conductor?*

**Conductor**: A material that allows electric current to flow through it easily because it has many free electrons.

## 2. Definition
Faraday’s Law states that **a change in magnetic flux through a coil induces an electromotive force (EMF) in the coil**.  
This is the basic principle behind electric generators, transformers, and many types of sensors.

It is based on the fact that a changing magnetic field creates an electric field.

- Motional emf (electromotive force), induced by moving a conductor through a magnetic field.
- Moving a magnet through a coil changes the magnetic flux and induces a voltage.
- **The faster the change in magnetic flux, the greater the induced voltage.**


### 2.2. In Formula Form


E = -N × (ΔΦB / Δt)

Where:  
- E = Induced EMF (in volts, V)  
- N = Number of turns in the coil  
- ΦB = Magnetic flux (in weber, Wb)  
- ΔΦB = Change in magnetic flux  
- Δt = Change in time  
- The minus sign indicates that the induced EMF opposes the change in flux (Lenz’s Law).


### 2.3. Example

If a coil with N = 50 turns experiences a change in magnetic flux of 0.02 Wb over 0.1 s:

E = -50 × (0.02 / 0.1) = -10 V

The negative sign means the induced EMF opposes the change in magnetic flux.


## 3. Usage

- Designing **electric generators** and **motors**.
- Building **transformers** for voltage conversion.
- Creating **inductive sensors** like metal detectors or speed sensors.
- Understanding induction heating and wireless charging.


## 4. Limitations

- Assumes a uniform magnetic field and coil geometry.
- Real coils have resistance and energy losses due to heat.
- High-frequency changes can cause additional effects like eddy currents.
