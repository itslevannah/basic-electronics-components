# The Two Laws of Electrostatics

## 1. Definition

The Two Laws of Electrostatics describe how electric charges interact with each other and how they are distributed:

* First Law: **Like charges repel, unlike charges attract.**
It States the **nature** of interaction:

* Positive ↔ Positive → **Repel**
* Negative ↔ Negative → **Repel**
* Positive ↔ Negative → **Attract**

*Second Law: **The force between charges is proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them** (this second law is essentially **Coulomb’s Law**).

### 1.1. Coulom's Law in Formula Form

**Second Law** ; Quantitative:
F = k · (q₁ · q₂) / r²

Where:

* **F** = Electric force between charges
* **k** = Coulomb’s constant (≈ 8.99 × 10⁹ N·m²/C²)
* **q₁, q₂** = Magnitudes of the charges (in Coulombs)
* **r** = Distance between charges (in meters)

### 1.2. Other Variations

* Vector form: **F**⃗ = k · (q₁ · q₂ / r²) · **r̂**
* **Repulsive** force if q₁ and q₂ have the same sign
* **Attractive** force if q₁ and q₂ have opposite signs

### 1.3. Unit of Measurements

* **Force (F)**: Newton (N)
* **Charge (q)**: Coulomb (C)
* **Distance (r)**: meter (m)
* **Coulomb’s constant (k)**: N·m²/C²

### 1.4. Example

If q₁ = +5 C, q₂ = -2 C, and r = 0.5 m:

→ F = (8.99 × 10⁹) × (5 × -2) / (0.5²)

→ F = (8.99 × 10⁹ × -10) / 0.25

→ F = (-89.9 × 10⁹) / 0.25

→ F = -359.6 × 10⁹ N

The **negative sign** shows the force is **attractive**.

If the result of **F is positive** then the force is **repulsive**.

## 2. Usage

### 2.1. Calculations

The Two Laws of Electrostatics help you:

1. Predict whether two charges will **attract or repel**
2. Calculate the **magnitude** of the force between charges
3. Understand charge behavior in materials and devices

### 2.2. Applications

They are used in:

1. Explaining **static electricity effects** (e.g., clothes sticking after drying)
2. Designing **capacitors and insulation systems**
3. Understanding chemical bonding and **atomic structure**
4. Electrostatic precipitators in **pollution control**


## 3. Limitations

It is important to note that the Two Laws of Electrostatics have the following limitations:

1. They apply to **stationary charges** only
2. They assume charges are **point-like** or spherical in distribution
3. They are accurate only in a **uniform medium** (unless permittivity adjustments are made)
4. They don’t account for moving charges (where magnetic effects also occur)
