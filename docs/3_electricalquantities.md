# Basic Electrical Quantities

## 1. Definition
Basic electrical quantities are the fundamental physical properties used to describe and analyze electrical systems.  
They form the building blocks for understanding how electricity behaves in circuits.

## 2. Main Quantities

### 2.1 Electric Charge (Q)
- **Definition**: A fundamental property of matter responsible for electric phenomena.
- **Unit**: Coulomb (C)
- **Symbol**: Q or q
- **Formula**: **Q = I . t**
  where I is current (A), t is time (s).

### 2.2 Electric Current (I)
- **Definition**: The rate of flow of electric charge.
- **Unit**: Ampere (A)
- **Symbol**: I
- **Formula**: **I = Q/t**
  where  Q is charge (C), t is time (s).

A simple electric circuit, where current is represented by the letter i.

### 2.3 Voltage (V)
- **Definition**: The work done per unit charge to move a charge between two points.
- **Unit**: Volt (V)
- **Symbol**: V or U
- **Formula**: **V = W/Q**
  where W is work or energy (J), Q is charge (C).

Batteries are sources of voltage in many electric circuits.



### 2.4 Resistance (R)
- **Definition**: Opposition to the flow of electric current in a conductor.
- **Unit**: Ohm (Ω)
- **Symbol**: R
- **Formula**: **R = V/I**
  where  V  is voltage (V),  I  is current (A).

A 75 Ω resistor, as identified by its electronic color code (violet, green, black, gold, red). Used to apply resistence in an electric circuit.

### 2.5 Power (P)
- **Definition**: The rate at which electrical energy is converted to another form (heat, light, motion).
- **Unit**: Watt (W)
- **Symbol**: P
- **Formula**:  
  - **P = V.I**

Electric power is transmitted by overhead lines like these, and also through underground high voltage cables.

### 2.6 Energy (W or E)
- **Definition**: Total electrical work done over time.
- **Unit**: Joule (J) or kilowatt hour (kWh)
- **Symbol**: W or E
- **Formula**:  **E = P.t**



## 3. Applications
Understanding these quantities is essential for:
- Designing and analyzing electrical circuits
- Calculating electrical consumption and cost
- Selecting proper components (resistors, fuses, wires)
- Ensuring safety in electrical systems
