# Batteries

## 1. Definition
### 1.1 Battery

A battery is an electrochemical device that stores and delivers electrical energy through chemical reactions.  
It can be:

- **Primary** : non-rechargeable (single-use).
- **Secondary** : rechargeable.

### 1.2 Types of Batteries

- **Primary:** Alkaline, Lithium (Li-FeS₂, Li-MnO₂).
- **Secondary:** Lead-acid, NiMH, Li-ion, Li-Po.
- **Specialty:** Coin cells, UPS backup cells, medical-grade cells.



## 2. Features

* **Voltage rating:** e.g., 1.5V, 3.7V, 12V.
* **Capacity:** mAh (milliamp-hours) or Ah (amp-hours), indicates energy storage.
* **Rechargeability:** whether the chemistry supports multiple charge cycles.
* **Internal resistance:** affects current delivery and efficiency.
* **Discharge rate:** maximum safe current draw.


## 4. How to Use
### Safety Note
Do not short-circuit, overcharge, crush, or puncture batteries, there is a risk of overheating, fire, or explosion.



### 4.1 Identify Polarity

* **Positive terminal (+):** usually raised or marked with a plus sign.
* **Negative terminal (−):** flat, spring contact, or marked with a minus sign.

### 4.2 Connecting Batteries

* **Single cell:** Connect directly to the circuit.
* **Multiple cells:**
  - **Series:** Increases total voltage (sum of each cell’s voltage).
  - **Parallel:** Increases capacity (mAh) while keeping voltage the same.
* Use a **battery holder** or secure mounting to prevent shorting.



### 4.3 Applications

* Portable electronics.
* Backup and emergency power.
* Electric vehicles.
* Renewable energy storage.
* Robotics and remote systems.
