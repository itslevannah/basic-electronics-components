# Tilt Sensor

## 1. Definition
A tilt sensor is an electronic device that detects the orientation or inclination of an object. It works by opening or closing an electrical circuit when tilted beyond a certain angle.

## 3. Types of Tilt Sensors
- **Mercury Tilt Switch:** Uses liquid mercury to complete a circuit.
- **Ball Tilt Switch:** Uses a rolling metal ball to make contact.
- **MEMS Tilt Sensor:** Uses microelectromechanical systems for precise measurements.

## 4. Applications
- **Safety Devices:** Detect tilt or rollover in machinery or vehicles.
- **Robotics:** Monitor robot orientation and movement.
- **Consumer Electronics:** Screen rotation in smartphones and tablets.
- **Alarms:** Trigger when moved or tampered with.

## 5. Key Points
- Simple, low-cost design for basic tilt detection.
- Some types are sensitive to vibration.
- Not suitable for precise angular measurement (use accelerometers or gyroscopes instead).
