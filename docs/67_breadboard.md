# Breadboard

## 1. Definition
A **Breadboard** is a reusable prototyping board used to build and test electronic circuits without soldering.  
It allows quick connections between components inside the board, metal strips connect the holes together so electricity can flow.

## 2. Types
- **Mini Breadboard:** Small size, limited rows/columns, for compact projects.
- **Half-Size Breadboard:** Medium size, often used in beginner kits.
- **Full-Size Breadboard:** Large board with multiple power rails for complex circuits.
- **Solderable Breadboard (Perfboard/Protoboard):** Permanent version for soldering components.


## 3. Common Uses
- Rapid prototyping of circuits.
- Educational electronics experiments.
- Testing and debugging circuit designs.
- Temporary circuit assembly before soldering.



## 4. Advantages
- Reusable and solder-free.
- Easy to modify or expand circuits.
- Supports integration with microcontrollers and sensors.
- Great for beginners to learn circuit building.



## 5. Precautions
- Avoid forcing component leads into the holes (may damage contacts).
- Keep power supply within safe limits (typically < 12V).
- Double-check wiring to prevent short circuits.
- Connections may loosen over time with repeated use.



## 6. Related Components
- Jumper Wires
- Microcontroller Boards (Arduino, ESP32, etc.)
- Power Supply Modules
- Resistors, LEDs, and Sensors
