# Ohm's Law
## 1. Definition   
Ohm's law states that The amount of electric current flowing in a wire depends on the voltage pushing it and the resistance slowing it down.


### 1.1. In Formula Form
V = I . R

Where:
- V = Voltage (push)
- I = Current (flow)
- R = Resistance (opposition)

### 1.2. Other Variations

### 1.3. Unit of Measurements 

The standard unit of measurements in ohm's law are:
- *Volts* represented by **V** for Voltage
- *Amperes* represented by **A** for Current
- *Ohms* represented by **Ω** for Resistance 

### 1.4. Example

If  *V = 12*  and  *R = 6Ω* , then I = V/R
which is I = 12/6 = 2A.
## 2. Usage 

### 2.1 Calculations
Ohm’s Law helps you calculate:

- *Current* if you know voltage and resistance: I=V/R

- *Voltage* if you know current and resistance: V=IR

- *Resistance* if you know voltage and current: R=V/I

### 2.1 Applications

It is used in:

- Designing electrical circuits
- Checking if a power supply can handle a load
- Troubleshooting why a circuit isn’t working properly
- Choosing the right resistor for LEDs, motors, and other components.

## 3. Limitations
It is important to note that ohm's law has the following limitations:
- It only applies to ohmic materials (where **resistance is constant** regardless of voltage or current).

- It doesn’t work for devices like diodes or transistors where the **relationship isn’t linear**.
