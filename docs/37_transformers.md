## 1. Definition
### 1.1 Transformer

A transformer is an electrical device that transfers AC electrical energy between two or more circuits using **electromagnetic induction**.  
It can **increase** (step up) or **decrease** (step down) AC voltage, while keeping the same frequency.

### 1.2 Types of Transformers

- **Step-down** : Converts high voltage AC to lower voltage AC (e.g., 230V → 12V).
- **Step-up** : Converts low voltage AC to higher voltage AC.
- **Isolation** : Same input and output voltage, but provides galvanic isolation for safety.



## 2. Features

* **Primary and secondary winding ratio** : determines output voltage.
* **Power rating** : in VA or watts (how much load it can supply).
* **Core material** : laminated steel (low-frequency) or ferrite (high-frequency).
* **Frequency range** : usually 50–60Hz for mains, higher for specialized transformers.



## 4. How to Use
### Safety Note
 **Mains-voltage transformers** can cause electric shock. Always disconnect power before wiring, and follow proper insulation and grounding practices.


### 4.1 Identify Windings

* **Primary winding** : connects to the input source (e.g., mains AC).
* **Secondary winding** : provides the output voltage.
* Winding labels or datasheet will specify voltage ratings.

### 4.2 Typical Applications

* **Power supplies** , converting mains AC to lower AC before rectification.
* **Audio coupling**, matching impedance between audio equipment.
* **Electrical isolation**, protecting sensitive circuits from dangerous voltages.
* **Signal transmission**, in networking and communication systems.
