# The Two Laws of Magnetism
## 1. Definition

The Two Laws of Magnetism describe how magnetic poles interact and how magnetic force depends on distance and pole strength:

* First Law **Like poles repel; unlike poles attract.**

 North ↔ North → **Repel**
 South ↔ South → **Repel**
 North ↔ South → **Attract**

* Second Law **The force between two magnetic poles is directly proportional to the product of their pole strengths and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.**

### 1.1. Second Law In Formula Form
Coulomb’s Law of Magnetism:
**F = (μ / 4π) × (m₁ · m₂) / r²**

Where:

* **F** : Magnetic force between poles
* **μ** : Permeability of the medium (μ₀ in vacuum ≈ 4π × 10⁻⁷ H/m)
* **m₁, m₂** : Magnetic pole strengths (in Ampere-meter, A·m)
* **r** : Distance between poles (in meters)
***Note*** : *μ₀ / 4π : is the magnetostatic Constent, where μ₀ is the permeabilioty of free space (vacuum),  use μ₀ when the magnetic interaction is happening in free space, wile μ is used when the medium is not air, like inside iron or another magnetic material!*


### 1.2. Other Variations

* Same pole types → Repulsion
* Opposite pole types → Attraction
* Force magnitude changes with **medium** (air, iron, etc.)
* The law is similar in form to **Coulomb’s Law** but for magnetic poles

### 1.3. Unit of Measurements

* **Force (F)**: Newton (N)
* **Magnetic pole strength (m)**: Ampere-meter (A·m)
* **Distance (r)**: meter (m)
* **Permeability (μ)**: Henry per meter (H/m)


### 1.4. Example

If m₁ = 4 A·m, m₂ = 6 A·m, r = 0.2 m, and μ₀ = 4π × 10⁻⁷ H/m:

F = (4π × 10⁻⁷ / 4π) × (4 × 6) / (0.2²)
F = (10⁻⁷) × (24) / 0.04
F = (2.4 × 10⁻⁶) / 0.04
F = 6 × 10⁻⁵ N


## 2. Usage

### 2.1. Calculations

The Two Laws of Magnetism help you:

* Predict whether two magnetic poles will **attract or repel**
* Calculate the **magnitude** of the force between poles
* Determine the effect of **distance** and **medium** on force

### 2.2. Applications

They are used in:

* Designing electromagnets and permanent magnets
* Understanding compass operation and Earth’s magnetic field
* Magnetic levitation systems
* Magnetic separation in industries


## 3. Limitations

It is important to note that the Two Laws of Magnetism have the following limitations:

* They apply to **ideal magnetic poles**, which don’t exist in isolation (magnetic monopoles have not been observed)
* They are valid for **short distances** compared to the magnet size
* They do not explain the **origin** of magnetism (which requires atomic-level theory)
