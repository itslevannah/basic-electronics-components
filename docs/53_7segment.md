# 7-Segment Displays

## 1. Definition
A 7-segment display is an electronic display device used to display decimal numerals and some alphabetic characters using seven individual segments that can be lit in different combinations.

## 2. Types
- **Common Cathode (CC):** All segment cathodes are connected together; anode pins are controlled individually.
- **Common Anode (CA):** All segment anodes are connected together; cathode pins are controlled individually.

## 3. Applications
- **Digital Clocks:** Showing time in numeric format.
- **Calculators:** Displaying digits and symbols.
- **Measuring Instruments:** Showing values like voltage, current, or speed.
- **Counters & Timers:** Visual representation of numerical data.

## 4. Advantages
- Low cost and easy to interface.
- Bright and visible even in daylight.
- Simple control using microcontrollers or driver ICs.

## 5. Disadvantages
- Limited to displaying numeric and a few alphabetic characters.
- Lower resolution compared to dot matrix or LCD/OLED displays.

**Note:** Handle with care and check the datasheet for correct voltage and current ratings to avoid damage.
