# Resistors

## 1. Overview
A resistor is a passive two-terminal electronic component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element.

## 2. Features

- **Measurement:**  measured in ohms (Ω).
- **Tolerance:** how much the actual resistance can vary from the stated value (e.g., ±1%, ±5% even ±20%)
- **Temperature:** resistance changes with temperature (measured in ppm/°C).
- **Physical Size:** larger resistors typically handle more power.
- **Fixed or Variable:** Can be either fixed (standard resistors) or adjustable (potentiometers, rheostats).


## 4. How to Use

### 4.1. Identify the resistor value 
- Read the color bands or use a multimeter.
- Value is given in Ohms (Ω).

### 4.2. Choose the right resistor 
- Resistance needed (Ohm’s Law: R = V/I)
- Power rating (typically ¼ W or higher)
- Tolerance (how much variation from the value is allowed)

### 4.3. Connect it correctly 
- Resistors are non-polarized (no + or - ends).
- Place it in ***series*** (resistor is placed in line with a component)to limit current.
 **=>** the total resistence is the sum of all resistors
- Place it in ***parallel*** (resistor is placed alongside another component) to divide voltage or current.
 **=>** resistence is less than the smallest resistor.
- Place it in **compound** to get a combination of series and parallel.
 **=>** resistence is determined by the interaction of series and parallel arrangements.

### 4.4. Connect it correctly 
- use a ***multimeter*** to check the voltage drop accross resistror ad current through the circuit 
- Ensure it's not overheating (if it is then choose a higher wattage).

### 4.5 Solder it or breadboard
- ***on breadboard***, push the resistor through the holes.
- ***on PCB***, solder the leads into the designed pads.
